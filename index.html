      <p>This is Meshy.</p>

      <p><b>Motivation:</b></p>

      <p>On more than one occasion, I've found myself in need of a simple (and free and accessible) tool for performing measurements, calculations, simple transformations, and other post-processing on digital meshes; the standard use case is 3D printing, e.g., jewelry. Existing tools are predominantly desktop-based, which makes them a hassle all around, hence this project.</p>

      <p><b>Features:</b> (very much under development, will add more)</p>

      <p>OBJ and STL imports/exports; calculation of surface area, volume, center of mass (with a position indicator widget); translations, rotations, scaling, floor, center; measurement of segment length, segment angle, circle radius and circumference, arc length, cross-sectional area; given an active measurement, scaling the model so that the measurement equals a given value. Controls with the mouse (MMB to pan).</p>

      <p><b>Units:</b></p>

      <p>Neither STL nor OBJ files have intrinsic units. From what I gather, software will often interpret one STL unit as 1mm; else, you'll have to specify input units.</p>

      <p><b>Limitations:</b></p>

      <p>Primarily tested in Chrome and Firefox. Will work in the most recent versions. Appears to work in Opera. No n-gons in OBJ files; only tris and quads supported, and imported quads are triangulated. It's wisest to have them triangulated beforehand. Only one model at a time; delete the current model to uplpoad a new one. Only actions under the "Transform" tab are undoable. Not guaranteed mobile-friendly and probably never will be. File size limits depend on your system and browser; I think it's best to stay under 50MB. If the page hangs, the file's too big. Or try a different browser. I've been able to import a solid 1.5M polys.</p>

      <p><b>Bugs:</b></p>

      <p>Probably. :( See the console (F12 key in Chrome and Firefox) for specifics of an error. Please email any relevant information to 0x00019913@gmail.com or drop an issue <a href="https://github.com/0x00019913/meshy" target="_blank">in the repo</a> if interested in further development. Merci beaucoup in advance. :D</p>

      <p><b>TODO:</b></p>

      <p>Manually resizing the floor, wall thickness calculation, mesh decimation, mesh repair, mesh slicing visualization.</p>

      <p>Thanks for using!</p>
